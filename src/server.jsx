Margin and padding will work without the border property also. The difference will be more clear with the following example."

                                Answer: "The CSS box model is a container that contains multiple properties including borders, margin, padding, and the content itself. It is used to create the design and layout of web pages. It can be used as a toolkit for customizing the layout of different elements. The web browser renders every element as a rectangular box according to the CSS box model."

                                Answer: "CSS border properties allow us to set the style, color, and width of the border. CSS outline property allows us to draw a line around the element, outside the border."

                                Answer: "Creating an overlay effect simply means putting two div together at the same place but both the div appear when needed i.e while hovering or while clicking on one of the div to make the second one appear. Overlays are very clean and give the webpage a tidy look. It looks sophisticated and is simple to design. Overlays can create using two simple CSS properties:"

                                Answer: "Absolute positioning is used to place the element which is then removed from the HTML document from the normal workflow without creating any space for the element in the HTML page layout. The element can be positioned respectively to the closest positioned ancestor; otherwise, if the ancestor is not found, the element is placed with respect to the initial container box. The values provided to the top, right, left and bottom determine the final position of the element."

                                Answer: "Overflow: the hidden property is used to specify the contentâ€™s clipping. We need to add scrollbars to the content area at the time of specified container size exceeding the content limit where the content gets enclosed. This makes the content invisible via clipping; also the overflow value will be hidden."

                                Answer: "The float property of CSS positions an image to the right or left as needed, including text wrapping around it. All properties of elements used before it remain unchanged. "

                                Answer: "Pseudo-elements provide special effects to some selectors. CSS finds use in applying styles in HTML markups. If additional markup or style is not feasible for a document, the pseudo-elements help by allowing extra markup without interfering with the original document."
